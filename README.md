# -Implicit-Wait-Demo
This project demonstrates the use of implicit waits in Selenium WebDriver with Java. It shows how to handle synchronization issues while automating actions on eBay. The first example runs without wait, while the second applies implicitlyWait() for stability. A simple and effective project for understanding Seleniumâ€™s wait mechanisms.
